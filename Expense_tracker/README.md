Personal Expense Tracking App

The app will let users type their expense category and amount directly into the terminal. It'll then save (append) that expense entry to a file. And finally, read the file to summarise the expense totals for that month.

## ðŸŽ¯ App Requirements

1. Ask the user to add an expense (name, category, amount)
2. Save expense entries to a `.csv` file.
3. Read the file to summarise the expense totals for that month
4. Show the user how much they can spend for the rest of the month (to stay in budget)


The final project will consist of 2 files:

1. `expense.py`: A class for creating and storing expense objects.
2. `expense_tracker.py`: The main application logic.

## âœ… Tasks

1. Create the `expense.py` class.
2. Create the `expense_tracker.py` file and write the main logic for the app.
3. Run the app to test it.
